Dear Dr Dominique Devriese,

Based on the reviews, I ask that you prepare a minor revision of your
TOPLAS submission and submit it as a revision to the current
manuscript.

Your revision consists of two parts:
1) The revised PDF that you will submit via the web site
2) A log of changes to your paper

Please read over the reviews carefully. In preparing the revision,
please log the changes you have made to your paper by copying the
reviewers' and associate editor's comments into the log. Under each
comment, state how you have addressed whatever problems or concerns
they point out. Upon submitting a revision you will be asked to enter
(copy/paste) your response in a text box -- please do not upload your
response as a separate document. Uploaded responses create additional
delays in review response time.

Please try to provide your revision in three months or less so that
the reviewers can still have your work in mind when they read the
revision. If your revision will require more time, please contact the
Traffic Manager directly (aclestis@gmail.com).

Best regards,
Andrew Myers
Editor in Chief, ACM

Comments to the Author
This is my second time reviewing this paper. Compared to the previous
submission, I am happy to report that the authors addressed most of my
concerns, and the paper is looking better. I think that only a few
revisions would be needed for the paper.

# Detailed Comments

## Introduction

* DONE > in particular [l36]

Capitalize.

## Section 4

* DONE > We have a public and a private future world relation that respectively what
> changes ... [l743]

Broken sentence

* DONE I have trouble understanding what "extensional" means in the paragraph on l769.
There is a comment saying:

> In practice, the extensionality of future worlds means that a future world
> cannot forget about region names in a past world.

Put this way, it sounds like "monotonicity w.r.t. world domains" would be a more
accurate description of the property.  But I still can't tell if there is
anything else that you mean by this, and what the connection is to solving
recursive domain equations, as hinted on l769. (I do see why monotonicity would
be important for _program reasoning_, as explained in l771.)

* DONE > The logical relation is defined found ... [l796]

Broken sentence

* DONE > The permit-write-local standard region only accept [l873]

"accepts"

* DONE > then all the active regions [...] are project [l925]

"projected"

* DONE > This may seem like an issue the $\mathcal{V}$ [l994]

Broken sentence.

## Section 5

* DONE Lau: I think the reviewer is right about this. Technically, malloc could have capabilities pointing out (we do not require the values in malloc to be safe, so we do not have a requirement that regions must be there for capabilities to be there). However, it cannot depend on what they point to in anyway (thanks to condition) 2.b.
> As described previously, the specification of malloc ensures that malloc has
> no capabilities pointing out of malloc. [l1138]

I do not see why this is the case.  Wouldn't the specification allow malloc to
keep in its internal state capabilities to external state, as long as it does
not use those capabilities to break external invariants?

* DONE ## Section 6

> and clears it(...) [l1180]

Missing white space.

## Section 7

* DONE > We have define [l1216]

Typo.

* DONE Lau: I added a footnote to address this. We use this notation in a few place, so it is wort explaining. Maybe we should move the explanation to the world section?
I do not understand the equation in l1321.  The brackets around $revokeTemp$
look like the notation for the update of a partial map, but there are no keys to
store the regions given as arguments.

  DOMI: yes, either introduce the notation somewhere or avoid using it (and simply mention a region name r with a side condition like "r fresh")
* DONE > In principle, one could reason solely in the semantic model [l1441]

Broken sentence.

## Section 8

* DONE Lau: Removed the Foonote.
Footnote 12 on l1663 still looks cryptic.

## Section 9

* DONE Lau: Maybe we should add a remark in the cover letter about this:
Lau: "With regard to the discussion of temporal properties and CFI, there is an important temporal aspect missing in CFI.
Specifically, a CFG will multiple interacting functions will include impossible control-flows because the CFG erases causality between call and return.
For instance, say we have function f, g, and h where f does some simple computation and returns and both g and h calls f at some point.
In a CFG for this interaction, there will be edges from g and h to the beginning of f and edges from the return point of f to g and h.
If we follow the CFG, then we can come from g to f via the call and from f to h via the return edge.
However, this is a control-flow that should never occur as f should return to g but the CFG does not capture this temporal aspect."
Lau: I have changed the formulation so it is more specific than "temporal property".

> Formulations in terms of a control-flow graph [...] do not take into account
> temporal properties [l1702]

I still do not understand what you mean by "temporal property" here.  To me, the
only thing the CFI takes into account is a temporal property; namely, that the
PC evolves according to the order imposed by the CFG.  I think it would be
clearer for you to drop this reference and go straight into the discussion about
g1.

* DONE > that the programs [...] behaves [l1713]

Typo

* DONE > the intend of this work [l1830]

"intent"

* DONE > If we added unbounded integers [l1834]

"bounded", presumably.

* DONE > the property talks about a the [l1853]

Drop the "a".

## Appendix

* DONE Please give the definition of $\stackrel{n}{âŠ†}$ on l2124.

Comments to the Author
The major concerns of the first round of reviewing have been addresses
in my assessment. There remain a few smaller things that should be
fixed, however.

* DONE Lau: Added two sentences explaining xi
- The authors explanation of the need for and intuition behind the
logical relation is overall very good. The only ingredient that
remains mysterious on first blush now is the role of the isopmorphism
\xi. I would suggest adding a sentence or two around line 712

* DONE - There is a half finished thought at the end of Section 7 (line 1441)

* DONE - line 1554 refers to "1" but I believe it should be "0"

* DONE - the comparison to Sewell et al. could perhaps be made clearer by
simply mentioning that Sewell et al.'s integrity theorem allows
reasoning that untrusted code will respect certain invariants. But
that those are the invariants encoded by the integrity+authority
confinement properties themselves. These two properties, unlike the
logical relation and the fundamental theorem proved in this
submission, are not parameterized by the invariants one might want
preserved by untrusted code. That would appear to be the fundamental
distinction and the invites the need for the more complex proof
technique.

Some typos:
* DONE - line 1180 (spacing preceding opening round bracket)
* DONE - line 1359 "we argue that we assumption 5" ...
* DONE - line 184 refers to "unbounded" integers when I believe the intent
was "bounded integers"
