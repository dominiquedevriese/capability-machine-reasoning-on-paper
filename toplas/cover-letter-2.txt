We thank the reviewers for yet a set of diligent reviews. We have made the following changes to the paper:
  - Added a footnote explaining confusing world update notation (reviewer 1)
  - Removed cryptic footnote regarding the worlds and reasoning about variable x in the awkward example (reviewer 1)
  - Rephrased the discussion of temporal properties of CFI (reviewer 1)
Further, we have addressed all the textual comments made by the reviewers.

I still do not understand what you mean by "temporal property" here.  To me, the
only thing the CFI takes into account is a temporal property; namely, that the
PC evolves according to the order imposed by the CFG.  I think it would be
clearer for you to drop this reference and go straight into the discussion about
g1."

A CFG for multiple interacting functions in some sense overestimates the ways a PC may evolve.
Specifically, a CFG erases the causality between calls and returns which forces us to consider impossible return flows.
For instance, say we have function f, g, and h where f does some simple computation and returns and both g and h calls f at some point.
In a CFG for this interaction, there will be edges from g and h to the beginning of f and edges from the return point of f to g and h.
If we follow the CFG, then we can come from g to f via the call and from f to h via the return edge.
However, this is a control-flow that should never occur as f should return to g but the CFG does not capture this temporal aspect.
