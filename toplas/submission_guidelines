From https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/simultaneous-submissions about papers previously submitted:
- the paper has been substantially revised (this generally means that at least 25% of the paper is material not previously published; however, this is a somewhat subjective requirement that is left up to each publication to interpret);
- upon submission, the author notifies the EiC(s) or PC(s) that the paper has been previously published or simultaneously submitted; and
- the published policies of the publications or conferences involved do not prohibit this.

Suggestion for additions in TOPLAS paper:
- POPL intuition for the LR.
- Some of the lemmas for reasoning about examples.
- Specification for malloc.
- Proofs of the examples. Specifically the part with worlds for when we return.
