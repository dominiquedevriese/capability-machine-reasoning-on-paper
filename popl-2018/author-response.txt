We thank the reviewers for their work.
We want to make three main comments and after that, we provide a more detailed list of responses to individual comments and questions below.

* Several reviewers comment on the practical applicability of our calling convention, its performance, its relevance with future evolutions of processors etc.
  While these are relevant considerations, we emphasize that the calling convention is NOT the only contribution of this work.
  In particular, we are the first to study capability machines using approaches and techniques that are at the heart of the POPL community: a condensed formal model of the programming language involved and advanced, rigorous machinery from PL research (Kripke step-indexed logical relations).
  We believe our work demonstrates the value of these techniques in this setting and will prove valuable for studying similar techniques in the future.

* Some other reviewers comment on the motivation of our calling convention, given that CHERI already uses a different calling convention using per-component stacks and a trusted stack manager.
  What should be made clear is that this alternative approach is not well described in the literature (how does it work precisely? what features are supported? etc), not well motivated (what security property is it intended to enforce?), and appears technically limited (how can it support higher-order interfaces together with many fine-grained components?)?
  Our paper does provide all of this for our calling convention: a precisely described calling convention for enforcing well-bracketedness of fine-grained components with higher-order interfaces.

* Reviewer D comments on the fact that we just offer a logical relation and not a verification technique (like a program logic).
  While such a verification technique might be useful for some purposes, our logical relation does constitute a mathematically valid reasoning technique that suffices to prove valuable properties of concrete programs.
  Offering a logical relation that can be used to reason about programs using either a fundamental theorem or direct arguments (but no program logic or similar verification technique) is standard practice in the literature (e.g. Ahmed et al., 2009, Birkedal et al., 2011, Devriese et al., 2016, Dreyer et al., 2012, Hur et al., 2011, Thamsborg and Birkedal, 2011 etc.).
