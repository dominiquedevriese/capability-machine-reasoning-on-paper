* Introduction and Talk Overview
* Placing the paper
** Abstraction story
*** Physics hardware -> Assembly -> High-level programming language
*** Abstraction failure is serious security vulnerability
**** Spectre example of hardware/assembly
**** Gadget example
** Need to solve this at all abstraction levels.
*** Solving this issue for high-level lang -> assembly is the purpose of secure compilation
* Secure compilation
** Preserve the properties of language after compilation. If we want it for security, then it is specifically preservation when compiling to assembly.
** Requires machine with enforcement mechanisms.
*** Could be capability machine.
** This work investigates how we should handle the low-level aspects of secure compilation.
* Defining WBCF LSE
