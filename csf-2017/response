We thank the reviewers for thoruoghly reading the paper. We will take all comments into
consideration for the final version of the paper.

Several reviewers comment on the complexity of the techniques we used:

* Review 19A: "My main reservation about the paper is that it depends on substantial experience with step-indexed Kripke logical relations, to appreciate the details of the formal framework.
  I don't have that experience, so I didn't manage to form a sufficient intuition of the details."
* Review 19B: "Second, the formal machine is still very complex and extremely difficult to follow (even after reading through the 82-page extended technical report)."
* Review 19C: "Where the paper is weakest is in the explanation of the logical relation that captures the capability safety of the machine, and in explaining how this relates to reasoning about the safety of the calling convention (e.g. scall and the other macros)."

We understand this reservation and we are thankful for the concrete suggestions of what we can try to explain better (which we will attempt to implement). 
However, we would also like to point out that from our point of view, the techniques we used are very natural here: for a lambda calculus with similar features, they would be considered reasonably standard.
We have spent quite some effort on explaining these techniques to a security audience that is unfamiliar with them, and we can of course always do better (particularly in Section 4, as pointed out by review 19C and in some other places).
However, reviewer 19C's comment is very accurate: "The authors have a very large amount of material to summarise in a relatively small amount of space, and the logical machinery is highly sophisticated and builds on years of advanced work in this space. So this was always going to be a non-trivial task."
Apart from the valid remarks about explanations that can be improved, we are worried that if CSF consistently assesses this sort of techniques as too complicated, then the result will be that state-of-the-art reasoning techniques from PL research will end up not being applied to security applications, which we consider highly undesirable.

## Review 19A:
"(It doesn't help that the only examples discussed are assembly programs that fit in quarter-page figures. Limitations might become apparent connecting to, say, a fully abstract compiler for a typed source language.)"

For what it's worth, we have some experience with proofs of full abstraction for compilers and such a result would be a very substantial additional result, that could easily fill a separate paper.
We see the current paper as a step towards that goal that is independently useful.

"One limitation whose importance I have a hard time gauging: local capabilities may only be kept in registers or stack.  We can't have arbitrary heap data structures full of different local capabilities.  Is that an important limitation?  Do we ever want to do efficient lookup of local capabilities from semantically meaningful keys?"

You seem to be asking about storing local capabilities in data structures like hashtables or trees which are typically allocated on the heap.
In our setting, local capabilities cannot be stored on the heap because there can be no store-local pointers for it.
However, it's perfectly valid to allocate data structures containing local capabilities on the stack.
They will of course be temporary, just like the local capabilities they contain, but we believe that's reasonable.  

""For simplicity, we assume that memory allocated through malloc cannot be freed." Is this a
show-stopper assumption to scale up to realistic code?" 
We do believe reuse of malloc-allocated memory is important in real code.
However, an explicit free call is hard to support in capability-machine because use-after-frees may allow an adversary to access memory that has been recycled and now contains capabilities of the trusted code.
Supporting a free would require a notion of capability revocation, which is hard to support efficiently.
A better solution for reuse of malloc-allocated memory would be the use of a trusted garbage collector which can guarantee the absence of use-after-frees and which we believe would combine well with our approach.

"... And is it essential that malloc is a built-in instruction rather than a library function?"
Malloc is not really a built-in instruction.
In the examples, what appears to be a malloc instruction is actually a macro that invokes a trusted malloc function implemented in software.
It's trusted in the sense that there is a specification that we assume it will satisfy.
The specification is in the technical report, and specifies a very standard contract for malloc.

"How does all this adapt to the multicore setting?  Does a zero-out-range instruction appear to run
atomically?  What about context switches in the midst of other standard code snippets you insert?" 

Generally, the stack is (as always) assumed to be thread-local.
Since we only apply plan to apply the zero-out instruction (or its equivalent loop-based implementation) to stack memory, we don't think this will be an issue, even if we extend the approach to a concurrent setting (which is currently out of scope).

"At one point in the paper, there is a "throw-away" remark that stack-smashing attacks are
straightforward to block.  I don't see how, if each function receives a pointer conveying access to
its full stack area.  Such pointers must be carefully restricted into subpointers for particular
local variables, like arrays.  Wouldn't it be easy to forget to restrict or to do it incorrectly? 
I suppose the main arguments of this paper are about protecting *well-written* programs from
attackers, but then don't well-written programs just avoid buffer overflows statically?"
Well, this was indeed poorly explained but the idea is that a compiler for a high-level language might be able to guarantee that the code it generates itself is well-written, but not that the programmer's code is well-written too.
In such a setting, stack-smashing could be prevented by the compiler code even in the presence of not-well-written programmer code, by only giving the programmer access to appropriately-bounded stack capabilities.

"I'm stuck on type-level details of the future-worlds relations in Section 4.1.1.  Temporary and
permanent regions are expressed as 4-tuples, but the inference rules for future worlds operate on
5-tuples.  Why is that?"
In Theorem 1, the set Rels consists of pairs of relations which is why what appears to be a 4-tuple is really a 5-tuple.
We apologise for the confusion.

"Can you give an intuition for why the logical relations should be step-indexed?  The restricted
nature of local capabilities seems to suggest that they won't be involved in the kinds of
self-reference that motivated the invention of step indexing.  Is it the global references that
force step indexing?"
No, local capabilities also require step-indexing.
An intuitive way to see this is that it's easily possible to construct cycles in memory, both through global capabilities and non-write-local memory, but also just as easily through local capabilities and write-local memory. 
Once you have a memory with cycles, you need a way to break loops to prevent cyclic reasoning and that loop-breaking is provided by step-indexing.

"... In general, can you give an intuition for why simpler proof techniques
wouldn't suffice?  (It's hard not to suspect a bit of overkill when the only example programs are as
short as they are.)"
This question is hard to answer since it's not really clear what "simpler proof techniques" you have in mind.
However, the system that we are trying to reason about is non-trivial: it contains encapsulation primitives, mutable references and a high-order heap that may contain cycles.
For a lambda calculus with similar features, the techniques we use are more or less standard and we are not aware of simpler proof techniques that can derive results similar to the ones we prove. 

"In Figure 9, is the beginning of `g1` right, where the 3rd line seems to overwrite the program
counter, effectively jumping elsewhere without saving a new return pointer?  Should the operand
order be reversed?"
Yes, thank you for pointing this out.

## Review 19B
"..."
We want to start by clarifying what we believe to be a misunderstanding. 
We do not see the capability machine formalisation as the next capability machine.
Instead we see this work as general work on developing proof techniques for capability machines that match state-of-the-art proof techniques for high-level lanuages.
This is also why we in the first contribution write that it is a "simple but representative capability machine".
We hope and believe that the proof techniques presented here can be used on real capability machines, such as CHERI, as well.
Like-wise for the calling convention, we believe that it can be used on real machines with the necessary capabilities.

"The second contribution in the Intro states that the capability machine "does not use separate per-component stacks but a single, fairly standard, contiguous stack", why is this a good idea?"
Well, the phrasing suggests otherwise, but the fact that it uses a single stack was not really intended as a quality in itself.
It does mean that we stay relatively close to established practice in compilers in this respect, which may be considered an advantage perhaps.

"In any case, the paper would benefit from a high-level overview of the capability-based runtime architecture. Will there be any operating system running on the machine? How many different types of runtime components do we see on the machine? What are cross-component calls like? Are these supposed to run at the user level or within the OS kernel? Is there concurrency? How will kernel threads or user processes fit into the overall picture?"

Well, essentially, we assume a single-threaded application running in a private address space.
The components all live in this address space and may communicate over higher-order interfaces.
Cross-component calls are scalls and returns.
Whether there is a kernal outside of this private address space (as in CHERI's hybrid architecture) or whether the current application is the only code running on the system does not really matter for our results. 

"What benefits will capabilities bring over the existing non-capability-based hardware?"
Well, in a capability-machine, a component is a much more fine-grained notion than, for example, a process in a standard OS.
You may imagine an OO application where every object is a component, and its private state is protected from interference by every other object, and our calling convention is used to guarantee well-bracketed control flow.

"One way to control the complexity of [call,scall,push,pop macros] is to probably introduce a more abstract notion of "stacks" and treat these function call/return macros as actual built-in instructions in Figure 3. This way, we can see clearly how function calls/returns would work under various settings described in Section 3."

That would work, but that amounts to considering a system with a trusted stack manager.
The point of our paper is that this is not needed and we can implement an efficient calling convention with the same effect in terms of a more lower-level primitive, namely local capabilities.
In future work, we are considering an approach such as what you suggest and show a formal correspondence.

## Review 19C
"In general, the proposed approach is couched in terms of defending against an adversary (who is bad), who might be trying to attack "us" (who are necessarily good). In practice, capability systems are for programming in the presence of mutual distrust. In this case, the adversary wants to know they have enough stack space, might want to provide their own etc., and so one can't help but feel that the presented model is limited."

This is a misunderstanding: our model is not limited in this way, as we discuss this in the discussion section under "Modularity": "It is important that our calling convention is modular, i.e. we do not assume that our code is specially privileged w.r.t. the adversary, and they can apply the same measures to protect themselves from us as we do to protect ourselves from them."

"As an aside, to the above, the system wide limitation in the calling convention that local capabilities be used only for the single stack seems suboptimal."

The limitation is actually less severe than you describe: it's perfectly fine to pass a local read-write capability to an adversary (or vice versa) and our calling convention allows this.
However, we cannot allow the same for callbacks, i.e. *executable* capabilities that are not the return pointer.
There is also the system-wide restriction that every write-local capability must itself be local, but that also does not preclude using local capabilities for other reasons than the stack.

"Why not adopt a model in which local capabilities also denote a "region" or "domain" to which they belong, of which there can be an arbitrary number, and stipulate that the adversary must have local capabilities only to their own distinct domain. One expects that a more general calling convention would emerge (necessarily complicating the logical relation and its existing notion of regions) that would e.g. allow the adversary to have their own stack if they wished (desirable if it wishes to ensure it won't run out of stack space) and allowing a more expressive style of programming."

There are several problems with the model you describe: where would the adversary store its return pointer (a local capability coming from someone else's "domain")?
Additionally, it's far from clear how your proposed system would scale to higher-order settings, i.e. how do callbacks get access to their (local) stack pointer when they are invoked?  

"I can't say I was convinced by the footnote claiming that an adversary wanting to give temporary access to a callback that doesn't live on the single stack is not essential. What evidence is there for this claim?":

Well, that's indeed a matter of perspective, as it depends on what you want to enforce.
What we mean with this footnote is that it's not a goal of the current work.
We will rephrase the footnote.
