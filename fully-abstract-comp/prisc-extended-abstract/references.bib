The text first elaborates capability- and object-based system concepts, including capability-based systems, object-based approach, and summary. The book then describes early descriptor architectures and explains the Burroughs B5000, Rice University Computer, and Basic Language Machine. The text also focuses on early capability architectures. Dennis and Van Horn's Supervisor; CAL-TSS System; MIT PDP-1 Timesharing System; and Chicago Magic Number Machine are discussed. The book then describes Plessey System 250, Cambridge CAP Computer, and Hydra System. The selection also discusses STAROS System and IBM System/38. STAROS object support and abstract type management, as well as IBM System/38 profiles and authority and programs/procedures, are described. The book highlights Intel iAPX 432, and then considers segment and objects, program execution, storage resources, and abstraction support. Problems related with capability-based architectures are also noted. The text is a good source for readers wanting to study computer programming.},

	abstract = {We propose that the phenomenon of local state may be understood in terms of Strachey's concept of parametric (i.e., uniform) polymorphism. The intuitive basis for our proposal is the following analogy: a non-local procedure is independent of locally-declared variables in the same way that a parametrically polymorphic function is independent of types to which it is instantiated.A connection between parametricity and representational abstraction was first suggested by J.C. Reynolds. Reynolds used logical relations to formalize this connection in languages with type variables and user-defined types. We use relational parametricity to construct a model for an Algol-like language in which interactions between local and non-local entities satisfy certain relational criteria.  Reasoning about local variables essentially involved proving properties of polymorphic functions. The new model supports straightforward validations of all the test equivalences that have been proposed in the literature for local-variable semantics, and encompasses standard methods of reasoning about data representations. It is not known whether our techniques yield fully abstract semantics. A model based on partial equivalence relations on the natural numbers is also briefly examined.},
